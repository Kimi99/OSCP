# Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.

In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems, potentially leaking sensitive data such as authorization credentials.

A successful SSRF attack can often result in unauthorized actions or access to data within the organization, either in the vulnerable application itself or on other back-end systems that the application can communicate with. In some situations, the SSRF vulnerability might allow an attacker to perform arbitrary command execution.

An SSRF exploit that causes connections to external third-party systems might result in malicious onward attacks that appear to originate from the organization hosting the vulnerable application.

In an SSRF attack against the server itself, the attacker induces the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface. This will typically involve supplying a URL with a hostname like `127.0.0.1` (a reserved IP address that points to the loopback adapter) or `localhost` (a commonly used name for the same adapter).

For example: HTB machine called **Sau**, had an SSRF [vulnerability ](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-58g2-vgpg-335q)on particular version of open-source software it was running called [request-baskets](https://rbaskets.in/web). The idea was to forward the request to the localhost and fetch some internal service information that are not accessible from the outside (e.g. port 80 was showing as filtered, but using the SSRF we can request the http://localhost:80 and the server will fetch the information for us since we are bypassing the access controls. Request appears to originate from a trusted location.
