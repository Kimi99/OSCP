When you start the Parallels VM, there will likely be a warning triangle in the top right of the application window prompting you to Install Parallels Tools. Click this to insert the Parallel Tools disk into the VM.

You need to remount the Parallels Tools disk in exec mode, so 
  cd /media && sudo umount cdrom0 

If the device is busy then you can unmount by right clicking the disk from the Kali desktop. 
Once itâ€™s unmounted, 
  sudo mount -o exec /dev/cdrom cdrom 
to mount again and make executable
  cd cdrom and sudo ./install.
